# CS433 Programming Assignment 3

This assignment is to implement five different CPU scheduling algorithms: First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS), Shortest-Job-First (SJF), Priority, Round-Robin (RR), and Priority with Round-Robin (RR).

`assign3_fcfs` is the executable file for the First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm. Run with `schedule.txt` as a command-line argument.

`assign3_sjf` is the executable file for the Shortest-Job-First (SJF) scheduling algorithm. Run with `schedule.txt` as a command-line argument.

`assign3_priority` is the executable file for the Priority scheduling algorithm. Run with `schedule.txt` as a command-line argument.

`assign3_rr` is the executable file for the Round-Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm. Run with `schedule.txt` and the quantum as command-line arguments. The quantum used in `example_out.txt` is 6.

`assign3_priority_rr` is the executable file for the Priority with Round-Robin (RR) scheduling algorithm. Run with `schedule.txt` and the quantum as command-line arguments. The quantum used in `example_out.txt` is 6.

## Original README.md
In this assignment, you will implement some basic scheduling algorithms discussed in the class. It is based on the programming project in chapter 5 of the textbook.

Complete the implementations of scheduling algorithms in the provided source files, and remove "TODO"s from the comments after you are done. Read on the course website for more details and submission instructions.
