Process 2: T3 has priority 3 and burst time 25
Process 3: T4 has priority 5 and burst time 15
Process 4: T5 has priority 5 and burst time 20
Process 5: T6 has priority 1 and burst time 10
Process 6: T7 has priority 3 and burst time 30
Process 7: T8 has priority 10 and burst time 25
Running Process T6 for 10 time units

T1 turn-around time = 45, waiting time = 25
T2 turn-around time = 90, waiting time = 65
T3 turn-around time = 115, waiting time = 90
T4 turn-around time = 25, waiting time = 10
T5 turn-around time = 65, waiting time = 45
T6 turn-around time = 10, waiting time = 0
T7 turn-around time = 170, waiting time = 140
T8 turn-around time = 140, waiting time = 115
Average turn-around time = 82.5, Average waiting time = 61.25
