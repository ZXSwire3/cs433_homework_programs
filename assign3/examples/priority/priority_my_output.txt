Description : test Priority scheduling algorithm
=================================
Process 0: T1 has priority 4 and burst time 20
Process 1: T2 has priority 3 and burst time 25
Process 2: T3 has priority 3 and burst time 25
Process 3: T4 has priority 5 and burst time 15
Process 4: T5 has priority 5 and burst time 20
Process 5: T6 has priority 1 and burst time 10
Process 6: T7 has priority 3 and burst time 30
Process 7: T8 has priority 10 and burst time 25
Running Process T8 for 25 time units
Running Process T4 for 15 time units
Running Process T5 for 20 time units
Running Process T1 for 20 time units
Running Process T2 for 25 time units
Running Process T3 for 25 time units
Running Process T7 for 30 time units
Running Process T6 for 10 time units
T1 turn-around time = 80, waiting time = 60
T2 turn-around time = 105, waiting time = 80
T3 turn-around time = 130, waiting time = 105
T4 turn-around time = 40, waiting time = 25
T5 turn-around time = 60, waiting time = 40
T6 turn-around time = 170, waiting time = 160
T7 turn-around time = 160, waiting time = 130
T8 turn-around time = 25, waiting time = 0
Average turn-around time = 96.25, Average waiting time = 75
